# D-Project1-Global-Sustainable-Energy-Dataset
This project visualizes and analyzes global sustainable energy data (2000‚Äì2020) using **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and **R Shiny** to uncover trends in renewable energy, CO‚ÇÇ emissions, and electricity access worldwide.

* **Dataset:** *Global Data on Sustainable Energy* (Kaggle, 3,649 rows √ó 21 features).  
* **Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, R Shiny (R, ggplot2, dplyr, shinydashboard), DAX.  
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, parameter-based filtering, interactive dashboard design, and regression visualization.  
* **Objective:** Explore the transition toward renewable energy and identify disparities in global access to electricity.

### üìä Dashboards & Insights

**Tableau Dashboard**
- Explored access to electricity, energy generation by source, and renewable growth across years.  
- Used maps, bar charts, and parameters (Top X) to identify top-performing countries.  
- Highlighted a steady increase in renewable electricity generation and energy aid to developing countries.

**Power BI Dashboard**
- Designed ‚ÄúGlobal Energy Development Indicators‚Äù with slicers, cards, maps, and line charts.  
- Created DAX measures to calculate renewable, nuclear, and fossil fuel shares.  
- Revealed that renewable energy share is rising while fossil fuel dependence remains high.

**R Shiny Dashboard**
- Built an interactive web app with filters for **year** and **country**.  
- Visualized:
  - Renewable electricity capacity growth (line chart).  
  - Energy generation mix (stacked bar).  
  - CO‚ÇÇ vs. low-carbon electricity (scatter with regression).  
  - Top 10 CO‚ÇÇ-emitting countries (bar chart).  
- Demonstrated negative correlation between CO‚ÇÇ emissions and low-carbon electricity share.

### üå± Key Findings
- Renewable energy generation increased steadily between 2000‚Äì2020.  
- Developing countries benefited from financial aid but still rely heavily on fossil fuels.  
- Low-carbon electricity adoption significantly reduces CO‚ÇÇ emissions.  
- Africa and South Asia show persistent electricity access gaps.
